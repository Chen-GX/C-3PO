This repo contains a proxy-centric alignment framework (C-3PO) that bridges the gap between retrievers and LLMs. Instead of modifying existing components in RAG, C-3PO introduces multi-agent system within a lightweight proxy model to simulate humen-like behaviors that optimizes the entire RAG pipeline while maintaining plug-and-play compatibility.
