The document mentions that the "formulation of the 'satyagraha' as a political movement and principle occurred in 1920"
This was presented as "Resolution on Non-cooperation" in September 1920 before the Indian Congress
2. Combining this with my own knowledge:
While the document states the formulation occurred in 1920, this appears to be specifically about the Non-cooperation movement
The first formulation of Satyagraha as a political movement actually occurred earlier in India
Gandhi first developed and used Satyagraha as a political movement in India during the Champaran Satyagraha of 1917
Even before that, Gandhi had developed the concept during his time in South Africa (1906-1914)

The document provides partial information focusing on the 1920 Resolution on Non-cooperation, but this wasn't the first formulation of Satyagraha as a political movement in India.
