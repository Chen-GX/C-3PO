During World War I, engineers in the United States and Great Britain worked on ways to record and reproduce, among other things, the sound of a German U-boat for training purposes. Acoustical recording methods of the time could not reproduce the sounds accurately. The earliest results were not promising. The first electrical recording issued to the public, with little fanfare, was of November 11, 1920 funeral services for The Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abbey, London.

It directly answers the question by identifying Sumner as the relevant American academician. The content is pertinent, providing background about his teaching focus and ideological stance.\nDocument 2: Relevance: Medium\nWhile this document provides valuable context about Albion Woodbury Small, such as founding the first Department of Sociology at the University of Chicago, it doesn't address the question directly. It primarily focuses on Small's contributions after the initial course was taught.\nDocument 3: Relevance: High\nThis essay explicitly states that Sumner was the first to teach a course entitled "sociology" in the English-speaking world in 1876. It elaborates on his influence and ideological opposition to Lester F. Ward. This information is directly relevant to the question.\nDocument 4: Relevance: High\nThis document discusses several individuals and early courses in sociology, mentioning that Sumner taught the first course titled "sociology" in the United States in 1875. This multiple mention of Sumner gives clarity to the initial question posed.\nDocument 5: Relevance: High\nSimilar to previous documents, it clearly states that William Graham Sumner was the first to teach a sociology course in the United States in 1875. This provides a direct answer with context about his focus.\nDocument 6: Relevance: Medium\nThis document is primarily focused on Albion Woodbury Small and his establishment of the sociology department in Chicago. It does not answer the question directly, even if it adds context about sociology's academic development in the United States.\nDocument 7: Relevance: Medium\nReiterates information about Albion Woodbury Small but does not address the main question concerning who taught the first sociology courses.\nDocument 8: Relevance: Low\nThis document discusses Vincent’s role in sociology but does not relate to the initial question of who taught the first sociology courses in the United States.\nDocument 9: Relevance: High\nThis mentions William Graham Sumner as the first professor of sociology in the United States and discusses his broader contributions to social sciences. It directly supports the answer to the question.\nDocument 10: Relevance: Low\nWhile it discusses Woodford’s role as an instructor with the term sociology in his title, it does not indicate he taught the first sociology course. The primary focus is not on the question at hand.\nAlthough documents 2, 6, and 7 have some related infomation about the question, they do not provide direct answers as document 1, 3, 4, 5, and 9 do. Therefore, we should focus on retrieving more information from these documents to answer the question.\n\nAction: [1, 3, 4, 5, 9]""",
