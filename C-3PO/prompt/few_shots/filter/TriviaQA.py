The addition of salt to the alcoholic beverage was suggested that same year in a story in "Hearst\'s International Combined with Cosmopolitan". The name "Bloody Mary" is associated with a number of historical figures—particularly Queen Mary I of England, who was nicknamed as such in "Foxe\'s Book of Martyrs" for attempting to re-establish the Catholic Church in England—and fictional women from folklore. Some drink aficionados believe the inspiration for the name was Hollywood star Mary Pickford.

Protestant writers at the time, and since, have often taken a highly negative view of Mary\'s reign. By the 17th century, the memory of her religious persecutions had led to the adoption of her sobriquet "Bloody Mary". John Knox attacked her in his "First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women" (1558), and she was prominently vilified in "Actes and Monuments" (1563), by John Foxe. Subsequent editions of Foxe\'s book remained popular throughout the following centuries and helped shape enduring perceptions\n\nDocument 3 (Title: Mary I of England): Mary I of England Mary I (18 February 1516 – 17 November 1558), also known as Mary Tudor, was the Queen of England and Ireland from July 1553 until her death. She is best known for her aggressive attempt to reverse the English Reformation, which had begun during the reign of her father, Henry VIII. The executions that marked her pursuit of the restoration of Roman Catholicism in England and Ireland led to her denunciation as "Bloody Mary" by her Protestant opponents.

Though she is finally in her father\'s favor again, considerable damage has been done. The events of the past few years have been enough to turn the princess into the bitter, cruel woman known as "Bloody Mary" for her angry persecution of English Protestants. When she became queen at the age of thirty-seven, she would burn hundreds of people at the stake for their religious belief, execute her sixteen-year-old cousin, Lady Jane Grey and imprison her own half-sister Elizabeth in the Tower of London.

Mary\'s death in 1558 led to her half-sister, Elizabeth I, taking the throne. Unlike Mary, Elizabeth was firmly in the reformist camp, and quickly reimplemented many of Edward\'s reforms. Philip, no longer co-monarch, deemed Elizabeth a heretic and illegitimate ruler of England. Under Roman law, Henry had never officially divorced Catherine, making Elizabeth illegitimate. It is alleged that Phillip supported plots to have Elizabeth overthrown in favour of her Catholic cousin and heir presumptive, Mary, Queen of Scots; however, these were thwarted when Elizabeth had the Queen of Scots\n\nDocument 6 (Title: Thomas Dempster): part of his military build-up against England and was at first identical to the English College there. This college was a refuge and rallying point for English Catholics fleeing the re-establishment of Protestantism after the death of Mary I and the accession of Elizabeth I. Mary had won for herself the popular title "Bloody Mary" for her methods in attempting to reimpose Catholicism on England. Philip II, who had been married to Mary 1554–1558, used the seminarians from Douai openly as agents. They were often in England illegally to establish contacts and maintain a bridgehead, so to speak, for reconversion.\n\nDocument 7 (Title: House of Tudor): throne from Protestant threats, she had 200-300 Protestants burnt at the stake in the Marian Persecutions between 1555 and 1558.

The Marian Persecutions of Protestants ensued and 283 Protestants were burnt at the stake for heresy. This resulted in the Queen becoming known as "Bloody Mary", due to the influence of John Foxe, one of the Protestants who fled Marian England.

It may indirectly relate as it discusses a film, but it does not answer the question regarding the composer. Relevance: Low.\nDocument 2 talks about a musical film called "Melody for Two" and introduces a song that became a pop standard. While it relates to "Two" in title and genre, it does not address the composer of "Two," given the ambiguity.
